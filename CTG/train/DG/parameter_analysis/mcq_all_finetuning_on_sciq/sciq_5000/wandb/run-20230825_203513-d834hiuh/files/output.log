All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing T5ForConditionalGeneration.
All the weights of T5ForConditionalGeneration were initialized from the model checkpoint at /user_data/CTG/model/t5-base-text2text-sciq-pretrain-on-sciq-train-passage-level-dtt-retrieve-8000.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use T5ForConditionalGeneration for predictions without further training.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
